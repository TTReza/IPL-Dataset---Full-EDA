# IPL-Dataset-Full EDA
I am going through a random dataset I found on Kaggle, which is about the Indian Premier League(IPL). The dataset usability has been shown 10 out of 10 so I thought why not give it a try? I tried to do a proper Exploratory Data Analysis(EDA) on the dataset. 

The dataset which I am working with contains all the information about IPL from season 2008 to 2016, meaning nine seasons in total. First of all, the dataset contains two CSV files, one is deliveries.csv another is matches.csv. But the thing is proper description is not provided in the data card by the author. The file named deliveries.csv is the ball-by-ball data of all the IPL matches including data of the batting team, batsman, bowler, non-striker, runs scored, etc. So there are 636 match data for each batsman and bowler along with their teams. After that, the other file matches.csv contains details related to the match such as location, contesting teams, umpires, results, etc.  Not wasting our time anymore let us dive into EDA!
